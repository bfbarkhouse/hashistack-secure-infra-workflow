This repository contains source code to demonstrate a "golden path" to secure cloud provisioning with HashiCorp's Infrastructure Cloud. There is a [detailed blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/a-golden-path-to-secure-cloud-provisioning-with-the-infrastructure-cloud) you can follow located on the HashiCorp company blog (link coming soon). The "azure" folder contains sample code for Microsoft Azure, but other clouds may be added in the future. 

This diagram represents the end-state “golden path” workflow pattern described in the blog post:
